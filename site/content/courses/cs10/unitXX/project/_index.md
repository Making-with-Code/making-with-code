# Unit Review: CLI Game Project

In this project, you will create game and write a terminal interface for it.


## [0] Game Options

You have four options to choose from â€“ Spelling Bee, Yahtzee, Mastermind, or Block, Load, Shoot.

Once you get your game playable, you can then scale it up to include more complicated interactions like viewing the rules, adding random elements, improving the menus, adding more puzzles, etc.

Below are the four games that you can choose to implement. Look at the provided pseudocode and try playing each game to help you decide which you'd like to do!

### [Spelling Bee]

[To play the NTY Spelling Bee, click here](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee)

  **SpellingBee Pseudocode**

```
loop
    invalid_letters = False
    user makes a guess
    loop through each letter in the guess
        if the letter isn't one of the allowed letters
          invalid_letters = True
    if invalid_letters == True
        tell the user not to use unallowed letters
    else if the key letter is not in the guess
        tell the user they must include the key letters
    else if the guess is already in the list of guessed words
        tell the user they have already guessed that word
    else if the guess is in the valid word list
        congratulate the user and add the guess to the list of guessed words
    else
        tell the user that the word isn't one of the words on your list
```


### [Yahtzee]
[To play Yahtzee, click here](https://solitaired.com/yahtzee)

For this project, you will implement a simplified version of Yahtzee,
which only scores the Aces, Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives, and Sixes.
You won't have to worry about scoring the more complicated rolls,
or creating an AI opponent.

  **Yahtzee Pseudocode**
```
initialize a scoring_options list that contains the scoring options
initialize the score variable to 0
initialize a dice list to hold your 5 die objects

create a scoring_function() that takes a scoring option as a parameter
    and returns the correct score

while scoring_options isn't empty
    loop through the dice
        roll the die
    user gets to view their dice and view which scoring_options are left
    loop 3 times
        user chooses which dice to re-roll
        loop through the re-roll dice
            roll the die
    user chooses a scoring_option from the scoring_options list
    call the scoring_function() and pass scoring_option as the parameter
    update score variable based on the results of scoring_function()
    remove the scoring_option from the scoring_options list

user views their final score
```

### [Mastermind]
[To play Mastermind, click here](https://www.webgamesonline.com/mastermind/)

  **Mastermind Pseudocode**
```
loop until the guess limit is reached
    right_place = 0 (how many pins are the right color and right place)
    right_color = 0 (how many pins are the right color but in the wrong place)
    user makes a guess
    if the guess is completely correct
        tell the user good job
    else
        loop 4 times
            if the guess pin is the same as the code pin
                increase right_place by 1
        overlap = set(guess) & set(code)          
        right_color = (len(overlap) - right_place)
        tell the user about right_place and right_color
```

### [Block, Load, Shoot]
You probably already know how to play this game, but incase you don't,
[here are the rules](https://ctac.esrc.unimelb.edu.au/biogs/E000331b.htm).
You can try playing with a classmate.


  **Block, Load, Shoot Pseudocode**

  ```
  initialize round variable to 0
  initialize fighter object from Fighter class
  initialize game_over to False

  while game_over == False
      find out from Fighter how much ammunition you have
      reset the Fighter so that it is not blocking
      ask the user what they would like to do, and save the users_choice
          if ammunition > 0
              the user can choose to block, load, or shoot
          else
              the user can choose block or load
      opponent_move is moves[round]
      if users_choice is "Load"
          if opponent_move is "Shoot"
              Fighter is now dead
              game_over = True
          else:
              Fighter gains an ammunition
      else if users_choice is "Block"
          Fighter is blocking
      else if users_choice is "Shoot"
          Fighter shoots and loses an ammunition
          if opponent_move is "Load"
              game_over = True
      round variable increases by 1
  if the Fighter is alive:
      You win
  else:
      You lose
  ```


## [1] Planning Document

This is a big project, and you will get lost or frustrated if you don't do some planning up front.
Before you start working on your project, you are required to write a project proposal and get it
approved by a teacher. *You can find your planning doc in your Google Drive folder called "Unit 01 Games Project: Planning Document".*

## [2] Deliverables


- A `Unit Review: Interface Project: Design Document` in your Google Drive folder
- A `project-interface` repository containing the following files:
   - `run_game.py` - when this file is run, the game should begin in the terminal. It will contain most of the logic of the game
    - `view.py` - your View class should handle all the printing to the terminal and user interactions
    - `game_object.py` - the class in this file should create the object that stores any necessary data about the game
    - `README.md` This is documentation for your project for other people who may want to use your project.
- `Unit Reivew: Interface Project: Self-Assessment` - Google doc. This is where you will self-assest your final project.
- Your notebook with your sketches and project process journal


**You can find more documentation about what each of the files should contain within the README.md file.**

## [3] Starter Code
You can choose one of these four games to implement. You will create your own game class and your own view class, but you will be given pseudocode to help you with the logic of how your game driver will work.

{{< code-action >}} The three empty files that you will implement are provided in the
`project-games` repo. Download it *onto your laptop*.

```shell
$ cd cs10/unit-review
$ git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/project-CHANGETONAME-YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.git
```



## [3] Self-Assessment
You are responsible for assessing your own project, though your teachers will let you know if they disagree and provide a final score.

In `Unit Reivew Project: Self-Assessment`, you are required to explain how your project should be scored, and to give evidence to support your assessment. The rubric is based on claims that you should be able to make about your learning in this unit.

The self-assessment is broken down into three areas:
- Practices
    - planning, iterative development, test cases, and readability
- Concepts
    - abstraction and UX
- Reflection

**To do well in this project, you should be able to concretely justify that you can do each practice and understand each concept by providing evidence from your code.**

### [Practices]
Each practice is something that a computer scientist does each time they approach a problem. You are required to self-assess your ability to do each practice.

For each practice you must provide the following:
- A score from 0-3
    - 0 - little to no evidence of practice
    - 1 - below average evidence of practice
    - 2 - above average evidence of practice
    - 3 - outstanding evidence of practice
- A justification of why you deserve that score
- Examples to support your justification


### [Concepts]
This project focused on key computer science concepts, abstraction and decomposition.
You are required to demonstrate your understanding of each concept through evidence based reflection.

For each concept you must provide the following:
- A score from 0-3
    - 0 - little to no evidence or understanding of concept
    - 1 - below average evidence or understanding of concept
    - 2 - above average evidence and understanding of concept
    - 3 - outstanding evidence and understanding of concept
- A justification of why you deserve that score
- Examples to support your justification
- A discussion of why each concept is important

### [Reflection]

Throughout the unit, you explored what it means to express yourself and your identity via digital art. The reflection is space for you to explore your responsiblity to society as technology creators by evaluating the implications of your work.

*It is marked purely based on completion and demonstration of effort.*



## [4] Sucess Claims

Successful computer scientists should be able to make the following claims:
- I can thoughtfully plan a large computer science project.  
- I can develop my project iteratively over time
    - I can track the development of my project by committing to Github consistently throughout my project.
    - I can systematically breakdown my project into smaller chunks  
- I can write code with readability in mind
    - I can use describe names for variables, functions, and modules
    - I can document my code in the README.md
- I can effectively use the principle of abstraction to make my code more efficient and elegant
    - I can write a function with at least one paramter
    - I can use manipulate control flow with conditionals
    - I can use loops to repeat commands
- I can effictively use the principle of decomposition to make my code more efficient and elegant
    - I can write functions to be used in different scenarios
    - I can write modules for different aspects of my project

**Keep the success claims in mind when coding your project and self-assessing yourself.**

## [5] Scoring

The project is scored out of 7.
- 1 point is assigned to the reflection
    - *By thoughtfully answering the prompts and putting effort into your response, you will receive 1 point*
-  6 points are assigned to the practices & concepts
    - *To calculate your score for the practices & concepts, look at the following bands:*
    > 0 = 0-3
    >
    > 1 = 4- 6
    >
    > 2 = 7 - 9
    >
    > 3 = 10 - 12
    >
    > 4 = 12- 14
    >
    > 5 = 14 - 16
    >
    > 6 = 16- 18

*Example score:*

    1 point for reflection
    5 points for practices & concepts (15/18)
    6 total points

#### Final Score

Your final score for the project will take into account your self-assessed score and the teacher-assessed score. Any score above a 5.6 will be rounded up.

> self-assessed score*(.25)+ teacher score*(.75) = YOUR FINAL GRADE

*Example final score:*

    Self-assessed score = 5
    Teacher-assessed score = 6
    Final score = 5(.35) + 6(.65) = 5.65 = 6
