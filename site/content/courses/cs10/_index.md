# Welcome to CS10

The CS10 course is the second year computer science. It is also comprised of three modular, standalone units. 

The second year of the course focuses on how computer communicate with each other. 


{{< expand "Unit 00: Networking" >}}

Perhaps even more than through computational power, computers have transformed our lives through networking. This unit explores how computers interact with each other and will give us opportunities to think about the behavior of larger systems, including how our lives are touched by computer networks.

{{< expand "Unit 01: Web Design" >}}

This unit focuses on UX/UI design by introducing students to HTML/CSS. We emphasis reading documentation and citing sources to create a personal cite they designed.

{{< expand "Unit 02: Web Apps" >}}
This unit focuses on web applications and human-center design. Students will form teams focused on creating a social computing app for thier community. 

## Act I: HTML (Django) and CSS (Bootstrap)

In this section of the project, students will become aquainted with Django and web programming. Teams will branch into two tracks, with one member learning the skills of a designer and the other learning

## Act II: Introduction to Human-Centered Design

With a solid foundation to what Django has to offer, students will learn about the human-centered design and the basics of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). 


### Milestone Event: Pitch
After learning about the basics of human-centered design and forming the foundation of their projects, 
students will pitch their projects to a panel of “investors” composed of students, faculty, and staff 
members of the school. This event will require students to distill their project plans into easily 
digestible pitches and prepare quality prototypes, moving them forward in the process of developing 
their projects. Additionally, it will offer them a chance to get feedback from members of the community.

## Act III: Django Unchained and UI/UX

In the final section of the project, students will prepare the submission versions of their projects. To do this, students will learn about UI/UX design as they test and iterate on their web applications. Additionally, students will push their applications further and in individualized directions by learning to read Django documentation. This skill will allow students to develop features independent of the basic features demonstrated in Act II and will prepare students for life after cs10.


### Milestone Event: L(a)unch Event

To close out the project, teams will launch their web applications at a launch party. At the launch party, student teams will demo their applications in an expo format. This will be a chance for students to showcase their learning and to market their applications.
