# User Stories


## Planning Documents
This project will require you to explore the theory behind efficient data
structure design. You will likely changes your plans frequently as you
try out different ideas for how to make your queue faster. 

As such, rather than a planning document, this project comes with an ideating document to
help you keep track of your ideas for designing your queue.
*You can find your ideating doc in your Google Drive folder called "cs10 -
Unit 00 Data Structure Project: Ideating Document".*

As we go through the development of a basic queue in class together, you
can start by using this document to take notes on how we design the queue,
the interfaces it implements, and ideas for how to make them better.
