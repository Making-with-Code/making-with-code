# Act I: Human Centered Design

Act I will focus on planning and outlining a Web Application for the ISF community. We'll follow a human center design cycle that focuses on ideating, defining, and designing. Each section will provide you with the tools and resources to thoroughly plan a project of this scale. 

This Act will culminate in a school-wide Pitch event where each group will present a working prototype fo their app to the ISF community.

## Deliverables 

Each stage of the design cycle will have specific deliverables. 

- Ideate
    - Jam Board
    - Google Doc with Finalized Problem & Solution 
- Define 
    - Google Sheet with User Stories & Tasks
- Design 
    - Wireframe
    - Digital Prototype
    - Pitch Presentation
- Self Assessment Form 


## Timeline

Each stage of the design cycle requires materials from the previous stage. It is vital that each group meets the deliverable(s) expected each day. By successfully following the timeline you will be well prepared for the Pitch event and the subsequent Acts.

## Assessment

For Act I of this project, you will be assessed on Criterion B, Criterion C, and Criterion D. 

For Criterion B, the rubric is based on your group's ability to thoroughly plan a web application. Each deliverable will support your overall plan and act as evidence for this criterion.  

For Criterion C, the rubric is based on your ability to reflect upon the planning process and communicate your conclusions to the ISF community 

For Criterion D, the rubric is based on your reflection of how your app will impact the ISF community. 

Each individual will submit a self assessment Google Form, in which you are required to explain
how your project should be scored, and to give evidence to support your
assessment. Additionally, you will reflect on the working relationship with your group member(s). 

**To do well in this project, we recommend you meet the deliverable goal for each class. This project builds on itself, so the best way to succeed to follow along with the steps we have laid out.**

As a reminder, here's a guide for using the rubric:
- Read the learning claims of the criterion for this unit in the rubric and consider how they relate to
the description of the criterion.
- For each learning claim in the criterion:
    - Evidence: Identify 1-5 elements of your project that provide evidence for the learning claim.
    - Reasoning: Provide specific reasoning that presents how the piece(s) of evidence you identified
    support the claim about your learning.
- Determine the level between 1-8 that represents your overall learning in the criterion based on the
evidence and reasoning you provided for the learning claims of the criterion.


## Rubric 

Your web application will be assessed with a rubric tailored to the skills and concepts the Act targets.
This Act is focused on developing the skills to plan a large scale computer science project with consideration to the impacts of technology we create. 


### Criterion B: Planning and development
> Students create personally meaningful projects through an iterative design cycle. Studentsâ€™ work is
> grounded in a development plan which students create before beginning the project. Students document
> the development of their projects in order to create a record of decisions, assumptions, and
> lingering flaws. Students define the intended functionality and develop towards evaluation.

In this unit, you will build a fully functional web application over the course of three months.
This will challenge your planning, researching, and iterative development
skills.

### Criterion C: Evaluation
> Students produce evidence of a testing plan that evaluates the main areas of functionality of the product and reflect on the development process as well as a proposal for further development to improve the shortcomings of the current product.


The Pitch event requires you to reflect upon the process of outlining your web application to ISF Community.

### Criterion D: Reflection on Tech and Society
> Students demonstrate an understanding of their responsibility to society as technology creators by
> evaluating the implications of their work. Students investigate the applications of their work to 
> specific problems or issues.

Each web application will provide a service to benefit the ISF community. What are the potential secondary effects of your service? What are the potential ethical considerations?
