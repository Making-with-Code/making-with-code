# Act I: Human Centered Design

Act I will focus on planning and outlining a Web Application for the ISF community. We'll follow a human center design cycle that focuses on ideating, defining, and designing. Each section will provide you with the tools and resources to thoroughly plan a project of this scale. 

This Act will culminate in a school-wide Pitch event where each group will present a working prototype fo their app to the ISF community. 


## Deliverables 

Each stage of the design cycle will have specific deliverables. 

- Ideate
    - Google Doc with Finalized Problem & Solution 
- Define 
    - Google Sheet with User Stories & Tasks
- Design 
    - Wireframe
    - Digital Prototype
    - Pitch Presentation
- Self Assessment Form 


## Timeline

Each stage of the design cycle requires materials from the previous stage. It is vital that each group meets the deliverable(s) expected each day. By successfully following the timeline you will be well prepared for the Pitch event and the subsequent Acts.

## Assessment

For Act I of this project, you will be assessed on Criterion B and Criterion D. 

For Criterion B, the rubric is based on your group's ability to thoroughly plan a web application. Each deliverable will support your overall plan and act as evidence for this criterion.  

For Criterion D, the rubric is based on your reflection of how your app will impact the ISF community. 

Each individual will submit a self assessment Google Form, in which you are required to explain
how your project should be scored, and to give evidence to support your
assessment. Additionally, you will self-reflect on the working relationship with your group members. 

**To do well in this project, we recommend you meet the deliverable goal for each class. This project builds on itself, so the best way to succeed to manage your time wisely.**

As a reminder, here's a guide for using the rubric:
- Read the learning claims of the criterion for this unit in the rubric and consider how they relate to
the description of the criterion.
- For each learning claim in the criterion:
    - Evidence: Identify 1-5 elements of your project that provide evidence for the learning claim.
    - Reasoning: Provide specific reasoning that presents how the piece(s) of evidence you identified
    support the claim about your learning.
- Determine the level between 1-8 that represents your overall learning in the criterion based on the
evidence and reasoning you provided for the learning claims of the criterion.


## Rubric 

Each project will be assessed with a rubric tailored to the skills and concepts the project targets.
This Act is focused on developing the skills to plan a large scale computer science project. 


### Criterion B: Planning and development
> Students create personally meaningful projects through an iterative design cycle. Studentsâ€™ work is
> grounded in a development plan which students create before beginning the project. Students document
> the development of their projects in order to create a record of decisions, assumptions, and
> lingering flaws. Students define the intended functionality and develop towards evaluation.

In this unit, you will need to build a fast, efficient, and effective queue.
This will challenge your planning, researching, and iterative development
skills.

### Criterion D: Reflection on Tech and Society
> Students demonstrate an understanding of their responsibility to society as technology creators by
> evaluating the implications of their work. Students investigate the applications of their work to 
> specific problems or issues.

At times during development, we need to make choices about what functionalities to prioritize. These choices
will result in improvements in some areas while resulting in degradation of others. To make these decisions,
we must consider on practical use cases of our queues to guide our choices in development.
