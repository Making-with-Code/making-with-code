# Act I: Introduction to User-Centered Design

For Act I, you will form small groups ... 


## Planning Documents
This project will require you to explore the theory behind efficient data
structure design. You will likely changes your plans frequently as you
try out different ideas for how to make your queue faster. 

As such, rather than a planning document, this project comes with an ideating document to
help you keep track of your ideas for designing your queue.
*You can find your ideating doc in your Google Drive folder called "cs10 -
Unit 00 Data Structure Project: Ideating Document".*

As we go through the development of a basic queue in class together, you
can start by using this document to take notes on how we design the queue,
the interfaces it implements, and ideas for how to make them better.

## Deliverables 

- Ideation Google Doc

## Assessment

The assessment for this project will be slightly different than
for your other projects. In `assessment.md`, you are required to explain
how your project should be scored, and to give evidence to support your
assessment.

For criterion A, the rubruc is based on the performance of your queue.

For criteria B and C, the rubric is based on claims that you should be able 
to make about your learning in this unit. Each of these claims comes with
examples of evidence that would show that you can make the claim about your
learning.

**To do well in this project, you should pass the test harness requirements
for criterion A and be able to concretely justify that you have achieved
each of the learning claims for criteria B and C.**

As a reminder, here's a guide for using the rubric for Criteria B and C:
- Read the learning claims of the criterion for this unit in the rubric and consider how they relate to
the description of the criterion.
- For each learning claim in the criterion:
    - Evidence: Identify 1-5 elements of your project that provide evidence for the learning claim.
    - Reasoning: Provide specific reasoning that presents how the piece(s) of evidence you identified
    support the claim about your learning.
- Determine the level between 1-8 that represents your overall learning in the criterion based on the
evidence and reasoning you provided for the learning claims of the criterion.


## Rubric 

Each project will be assessed with a rubric tailored to the skills and concepts the project targets.
This project is focused on developing the skills learned throughout the drawing unit. 


### Criterion B: Planning and development
> Students create personally meaningful projects through an iterative design cycle. Studentsâ€™ work is
> grounded in a development plan which students create before beginning the project. Students document
> the development of their projects in order to create a record of decisions, assumptions, and
> lingering flaws. Students define the intended functionality and develop towards evaluation.

In this unit, you will need to build a fast, efficient, and effective queue.
This will challenge your planning, researching, and iterative development
skills.

### Criterion D: Reflection on Tech and Society
> Students demonstrate an understanding of their responsibility to society as technology creators by
> evaluating the implications of their work. Students investigate the applications of their work to 
> specific problems or issues.

At times during development, we need to make choices about what functionalities to prioritize. These choices
will result in improvements in some areas while resulting in degredation of others. To make these decisions,
we must consider on practical use cases of our queues to guide our choices in development.
