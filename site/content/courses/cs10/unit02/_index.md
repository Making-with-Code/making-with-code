This unit will focus on web applications and user-center design. Students will form teams focused on creating something for the ISF community. This could be a solution to a problem or a virtual experience for members of the community. 

## Act I: Introduction to User-Centered Design

As they begin to design their projects, students will learn about the user-centered design and the basics of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Additionally, students will take on roles which will partially define how they contribute to the project throughout the experience.

## Act II: HTML (Django) and CSS (Bootstrap)

In this section of the project, students will regroup after the pitch event and make plans for their remaining time. Simultaneously, students will learn the basics of HTML, Django, CSS, and Bootstrap to make a simple web application which can serve as a foundation for the web applications they ultimately build for their projects.

## Act III: Django Unchained and UI/UX

In the final section of the project, students will prepare the submission versions of their projects. To do this, students will learn about UI/UX design as they test and iterate on their web applications. Additionally, students will push their applications further and in individualized directions by learning to read Django documentation. This skill will allow students to develop features independent of the basic features demonstrated in Act II and will prepare students for life after cs10.


## Milestone Event: L(a)unch Party

To close out the project, teams will launch their web applications at a launch party to which the entire school will be invited. At the launch party, student teams will demo their applications in an expo format as attendees walk around the space. This will be a chance for students to showcase their learning and to market their applications. Since the applications will be designed for the ISF community, they can generate a userbase by getting attendees excited about their application.
