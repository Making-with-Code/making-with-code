# Unit 00 Hardware Project
In this project you will act as a data collector hired by ISF to assess the water quality of different areas around the school. Using sensors to collect the data and Python to analyze the data, you will produce a comprehensive data report. 
This project will be broken up into two sections. 
- Hardware and Data Collection
- Data analysis and report 

## Planning Document 
This is a large scale project that demands ample planning before tinkering. Before you start working on your project, you are required to complete your project planning document and review with with a teacher. You can find your planning doc in your repository called `project_plan.md`.

Once you have completed the above, meet with a teacher to talk through your plan. Don't start programming until you get your plan approved, or you might have to change it.

## Rubric

### [Planning and Documentation]

- I can thoroughly plan out a large scale project 
- Details steps with test cases and edge cases 
- Github w/ commits
- Documentation 

### [Computational Thinking]

- I can read documentation 
- Evidence of how you read through the data sheet 
- I understand how to affect hardware using Python code 
- I can use abstraction and decomposition 
- File i/o 
- Parameterized functions 
- Debugging 

### [Relationship of Tech & Society]

- 


## Deliverables

A project repository with the following files:
- `project_plan.md` - planning document 
- `data.csv` - a file that stores the collected data formatted for your given sensor - `data_collection.py` - a Python file that handles the collection of data over the course of 24 hours for your given sensor 
- `data_anaylsis.py` - a jupyter notebook file that analyzes the data with at least 3 graphs 
- `README.md` - your data_analysis.py should be well documented so another user could easily use your program to run their own data analysis 
- `assessment.md` - a self assessment of your final project
