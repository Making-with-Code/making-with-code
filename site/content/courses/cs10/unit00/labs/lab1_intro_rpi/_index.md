# Fresh Baked Pi ðŸ¥§
This year, you'll be using Raspberry Pi's as our computational companions. Before you get too excited, these
are not warm, flakey baked goods, these are tiny computers built entirely on a single circuit board.

But even if these Pi's might not be as tasty as edible raspberry pies, they are still pretty exciting!

## Raspberry what?
Raspberry Pi's are tiny but powerful computers that can be used for tons of DIY projects. Since Raspberry
Pi's are so small but have full computational, networking, and hardware capabilities, they are great tools
for making robots, internet of things devices, networking services, and much more.
