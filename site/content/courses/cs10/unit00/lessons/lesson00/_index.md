## Last year

- What kinds of new thinking did you learn to do? Which of it was individual
  (cognitive), which was social or collaborative (situated), and which was about how bigger forces shape social and group practices 
  (critical)?
- One name for learning to think-with-tools is "material intelligence." What kinds of tools for thinking did you learn to use last year? Which
  tools supported your cognitive, situated, and critical thinking?
