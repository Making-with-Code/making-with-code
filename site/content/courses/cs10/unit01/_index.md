## Labs

- HTTP requests and responses to send and recieve environmental information from a
central server. Students will learn about the basics of the HTTP  protocol (status
codes and methods), and data serialization via JSON.
- TCP/IP simulation. We will enact a real-world TCP/IP Simulation, discuss network
security, hacking, and surveillance.
- Writing clients and servers 


## Project

Microservices. Each student will write a server which responds to network requests.
Some examples might be a tennis stat tracking app, a recipe holder, or an age calculator. 

A simple web front-end, and CLI will be provided for consuming microservices.
