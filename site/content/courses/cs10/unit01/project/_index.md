# Unit Networking: Server Project

In this project, you will create a server using Banjo. It is up to you to create a server with a user in mind. 


## [1] Planning Document

This is a big project, and you will get lost or frustrated if you don't do some planning up front.
Before you start working on your project, you are required to write a project proposal and get it
approved by a teacher. *You can find your planning doc in your Google Drive folder called "Unit Networking Project: Planning Document".*

## [2] Deliverables


- A `Unit Networking Project: Planning Document` in your Google Drive folder
- A `project-networking` repository containing the following files:
   - `models.py` - when this file is run, the game should begin in the terminal. It will contain most of the logic of the game
    - `views.py` - your View class should handle all the printing to the terminal and user interactions
    - `README.md` This is documentation for your project for other people who may want to use your project.
- `Unit Networking Project: Self-Assessment` - Google doc. This is where you will self-assess your final project.


**You can find more documentation about what each of the files should contain within the README.md file.**

## [3] Starter Code

{{< code-action >}} The three empty files that you will implement are provided in the
`terminal-game-project` repo. Download it *onto your laptop*.

```shell
$ cd cs10/unit_01
$ git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/project-networking-YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.git
```



## [4] Self-Assessment
You are responsible for assessing your own project, though your teachers will let you know if they disagree and provide a final score.

In `Unit Networking Project: Self-Assessment`, you are required to explain how your project should be scored, and to give evidence to support your assessment. The rubric is based on claims that you should be able to make about your learning in this unit.

The self-assessment is broken down into three areas:
- Practices
    - test cases, reading documentation, readability, and debugging
- Concepts
    - model architecture and http requests
- Reflection

**To do well in this project, you should be able to concretely justify that you can do each practice and understand each concept by providing evidence from your code.**

### [Practices]
Each practice is something that a computer scientist does each time they approach a problem. You are required to self-assess your ability to do each practice.

For each practice you must provide the following:
- A score from 0-3
    - 0 - no evidence of the practice
    - 1 - limited evidence of the practice
    - 2 - adequate evidence of the practice
    - 3 - substantial evidence of the practice
- A justification of why you deserve that score
- Examples to support your justification


### [Concepts]
This project focused on key computer science concepts, abstraction and decomposition.
You are required to demonstrate your understanding of each concept through evidence based reflection.

For each concept you must provide the following:
- A score from 0-3
    - 0 - no to no evidence of the concept
    - 1 - limited evidence of the concept
    - 2 - adequate evidence of the concept
    - 3 - substantial evidence of the concept
- A justification of why you deserve that score
- Examples to support your justification
- A discussion of why each concept is important

### [Reflection]

As we reviewed how to make and use classes, you explored how user interactions work, and the possible ways we can display information and ask for input from a user. The reflection is space for you to think more deeply about the user experience by evaluating the implications of your design choices.


## [5] Success Claims

Successful computer scientists should be able to make the following claims:
- I can thoughtfully architect a large computer science project.
  - I can use descriptive names for variables, functions, properties, methods, classes, and files
  - I can add comments that explain the purpose of each function, method, and class
  - I can document my code in the README.md
- I can turn pseudocode and flow-charts into working code
  - I use flow control, loops, functions, and methods effectively
  - I can use terminal menus where appropriate
  - I can write user interactions that make sense to the user
- I can develop my project iteratively over time
  - I can track the development of my project by committing to Github consistently throughout my project.
  - I can systematically breakdown my project into smaller chunks
- I can test my project well
  - I have tested the expected user scenarios
  - I have tested or prevented unexpected user scenarios
- I use classes effectively
  - I can create a class
  - I can import and use existing classes
  - I can write methods that use parameters and return statements
- I can separate back-end functionality from front-end functionality
  - I can keep all print statements and inputs in my view class
  - I can keep all logic in my driver file
  - I can use the game class to store the relevant data points


**Keep the success claims in mind when coding your project and self-assessing yourself.**

## [6] Scoring

The project is scored out of 7.
- 1 point is assigned to the reflection
    - *By thoughtfully self-assessing your project and thoughtfully answering the reflection points, you will receive 1 point*
-  6 points are assigned to the practices & concepts
    - *To calculate your score for the practices & concepts, look at the following bands:*
    > 0 = 0-1
    >
    > 1 = 2-3
    >
    > 2 = 4-6
    >
    > 3 = 7-9
    >
    > 4 = 10-12
    >
    > 5 = 13-15
    >
    > 6 = 16-18

*Example score:*

    1 point for reflection and 
    5 points for practices & concepts (15/18)
    6 total points
