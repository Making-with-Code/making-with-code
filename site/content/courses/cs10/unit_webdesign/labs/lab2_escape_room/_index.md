# Escape Room


ðŸ’» **Go to [escape.wolfie.dev/](escape.wolfie.dev/)**.

ðŸ’» **Solve the puzzle on each page to get out of each "room" (webpage) of this escape room.** You will need to find (or figure out) a password. Once you have that password, you can use it to move on to the next page by appending it to the URL. 

> *For example, if you think that the password hidden in this room is "password", you should enter `escape.wolfie.dev/password` into the URL bar.*


ðŸ”Ž **Goodluck! Be careful, things aren't always what they seem to be.**
