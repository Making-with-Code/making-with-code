In this lab, each student will be the designer and the developer. Each student will select a context to design for and then exchange design sheets with their partners. They are then in charge of bringining their partner's design to life. 

The `/amusement` and `/weather` directories are different contexts students will design for and contains an HTML document
with information for that contexts.

Here are the provided contexts:
- [Weather Alert](weather/)
- [Amusement Park](amusement/)

The `/flexbox_example` directory contains code for creating a side-by-side content. 


‚úèÔ∏è **First, complete the design worksheet.** 


üíª **Second, exchange design documents and implement your partners design in `HTML` and `CSS`.** This will require you to write `CSS` rules for various HTML elements. You may even want to implement `class` and `id` selectors for layout components and finer tuning of aesthetic design.
