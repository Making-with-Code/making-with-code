## [0] Explore Games


üëæ **Start by exploring a couple of example choose your own adventure games.** As you play, consider the different genres and what's possible with this structure. 
- [Harry Potter - Sorting Hat](https://unfold.studio/stories/303/)
- [Oregon Trail 1971](https://unfold.studio/stories/10782/)
- [City Exploration](https://unfold.studio/stories/2649/)
- [Store front Example, variables](https://unfold.studio/stories/1065/)

## [0] Planning Document

This is a big project with a lot of room for customization. You will need to:
- outline your story in a graph diagram 
- plan the implementation of an additional feature 

It is important for you to plan the game prior to coding.

##  [1] Set Up

{{< code-action "Start by going into your" >}} `cs9/unit02_games` **folder.**
```shell
cd ~/desktop/making_with_code/cs9/unit02_games
```

{{< code-action "Clone your starter code." >}} Be sure to change `yourgithubusername` to your actual Github username.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/project_game_story_yourgithubusername
```

{{< code-action "Enter the Poetry shell and install the requirements:" >}}
```shell
poetry shell
poetry install
```

This repo includes the following files:
 - `game.py` when this program runs, it should launch your game
    - `view.py`
    - `story_setup.py`
    - `story.py`
    - `node.py`
    - `README.md` - a brief description of your game

## [2] Assessment


‚úÖ  **This project will be assessed on the following criteria:**
- **Planning [3]** 
    - I can consider the components of my game before coding
    - I can create a graph diagram to outline the branches of my story
    - game outline
    - graph diagram 
    - feature architecture 
- **Iterative Development [3]**
    - I can track the development of my project by successfully committing to Github a minimum of each class work day, preferably after each work session
    - I can write descriptive commit messages that accurately describe the changes made
    - I can systematically breakdown my project into smaller chunks  
- **Readability [3]**
    - I can write code as readable as possible for another CS student to understand
    - I can use descriptive names for modules, variables, classes, and methods
    - I can write descriptive comments to describe complex pieces of the code
    - I can design a `View` that is easily to read and understand 
- **Feature implementation [3]**
    - feature architecture here? 
    - abstraction 
- **Game implementation [3]**
    - I can write game with story that is fully functional 
    - I can properly implement my graph diagram




**For each criteria you will be assessed on a score from 0-3. With 9 criteria, there is a total of 9 potential points.** 
- 0 - no evidence of the practice
- 1 - limited evidence of the practice
- 2 - adequate evidence of the practice
