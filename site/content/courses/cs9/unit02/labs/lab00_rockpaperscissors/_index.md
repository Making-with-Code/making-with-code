# Rock, Paper, Scissors 

In this lab, you will be re-introduced to the Terminal, Python syntax, and logical flow.

---

## [0] Setup

{{< code-action "Download Visual Studio Code:" >}} [HERE](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Atom is no longer being developed, so we have decided to switch to VScode, one of the most popular code editors. 

{{< code-action "Start by opening the Terminal cloning this lab onto your laptop." >}} As a reminder, we will run this command at the start of each lab.
```shell
mwc update
```

{{< code-action "In the Terminal, type the following command to open the lab folder." >}}
```shell
cd ~/desktop/making_with_code/cs9/unit02_games/lab_rockpaperscissors
```

{{< aside "Windows Users" >}}

I suggest not copying the path command, and instead using `cd` and `ls` to ensure you are in the correct `making_with_code` folder.

{{< /aside >}}

{{< code-action "Enter the Poetry Shell." >}} We will also run this command at the start of each lab, but only when we are inside a lab folder.
```shell
poetry shell
```
{{< aside "Exiting the poetry shell" >}}
When you want to exit the shell, you can type `exit` or `^D`
{{< /aside >}}

{{< code-action "Take a look at the files inside with:" >}} `ls`
- `variable_test0.py`
- `variable_test1.py`
- `variable_test2.py`
- `responsive_drawing.py`
