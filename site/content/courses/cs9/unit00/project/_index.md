# Unit 00 Drawing Project

In this project you will make an animated drawing (or a GIF!) using Python's turtle library.

It's up to you to make a drawing you actually care about making. Your teachers will help you choose a project that's a good level of challenge.



## [0] Design Document

This is a big project, and you will get lost or frustrated if you don't do some planning up front. You are required to write a project design document and get it approved by a teacher. Your design document can be found in your Google Drive folder.

ðŸ‘€ **Before you start the bulk of the design document, spend 10-15 minutes creating an inspiration board.** Use the internet to search for inspiration.

{{< expand "Project examples from previous years" >}}

Here are a few examples from last year to get you started. More can be found at the `gallery` page.

ðŸ‘€ **Take a look at** [these](https://github.com/the-isf-academy/cs9-example-projects) **example projects**.

Feel free to just look at the code via Github. If you'd like to clone it onto your computer:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/cs9-example-projects.git
```

Compare and contrast the project in folder `A` and folder `B` keeping in mind how the project will be [assessed](http://cs.fablearn.org/courses/cs9/unit00/project/#3-self-assessment).

**In your notebook answer the following prompts:**
- Which project do you think better demonstrates the practices and concepts?
- List 3 reasons why you picked that project.

{{< write-action "With a project idea and keeping the examples projects, fill out your design doc in your Google Drive folder." >}}


**Once you have completed your design document, meet with a teacher to talk through your project.**

## [3] Self-Assessment
You are responsible for assessing your own project, though your teachers will let you know if they disagree and provide a final score.

In `Unit 00 Animation Project: Self-Assessment`, you are required to explain how your project should be scored, and to give evidence to support your assessment. The rubric is based on claims that you should be able to make about your learning in this unit.

The self-assessment is broken down into three areas:
- Practices
    - planning, iterative development, test cases, and readability
- Concepts
    - abstraction and decomposition
- Reflection

**To do well in this project, you should be able to concretely justify that you can do each practice and understand each concept by providing evidence from your code.**

### [Practices]
Each practice is something that a computer scientist does each time they approach a problem. You are required to self-assess your ability to do each practice.

For each practice you must provide the following:
- A score from 0-3
    - 0 - little to no evidence of practice
    - 1 - sporadic evidence of practice
    - 2 - frequent evidence of practice
    - 3 - consistent use of the practice
- A justification of why you deserve that score
- Examples to support your justification


### [Concepts]
This project focused on key computer science concepts, abstraction and decomposition.
You are required to demonstrate your understanding of each concept through evidence based reflection.

For each concept you must provide the following:
- A score from 0-3
    - 0 - little to no evidence of concept
    - 1 - sporadic evidence of concept
    - 2 - frequent evidence of concept
    - 3 - consistent evidence of concept
- A justification of why you deserve that score
- Examples to support your justification
- A discussion of why each concept is important

### [Reflection]

Throughout the unit, you explored what it means to express yourself and your identity via digital art. The reflection is space for you to explore your responsiblity to society as technology creators by evaluating the implications of your work.

*It is marked purely based on completion and demonstration of effort.*



## [4] Success Claims

Successful computer scientists should be able to make the following claims:
- I can thoughtfully plan a large computer science project.  
- I can develop my project iteratively over time
    - I can track the development of my project by committing to Github consistently throughout my project.
    - I can systematically breakdown my project into smaller chunks  
- I can write code with readability in mind
    - I can use describe names for variables, functions, and modules
    - I can document my code in the README.md
- I can effectively use the principle of abstraction to make my code more efficient and elegant
    - I can write a function with at least one paramter
    - I can use manipulate control flow with conditionals
    - I can use loops to repeat commands
- I can effictively use the principle of decomposition to make my code more efficient and elegant
    - I can write functions to be used in different scenarios
    - I can write modules for different aspects of my project

**Keep the success claims in mind when coding your project and self-assessing yourself.**

## [5] Scoring

The project is scored out of 7.
- 1 point is assigned to the reflection
    - *By thoughtfully answering the prompts and putting effort into your response, you will receive 1 point*
-  6 points are assigned to the practices & concepts
    - *To calculate your score for the practices & concepts, look at the following bands:*
    > 0 = 0-1
    >
    > 1 = 2-3
    >
    > 2 = 4-6
    >
    > 3 = 7-9
    >
    > 4 = 10-12
    >
    > 5 = 13-15
    >
    > 6 = 16-18

*Example score:*

    1 point for reflection
    5 points for practices & concepts (15/18)
    6 total points

#### Final Score

Your final score for the project will take into account your self-assessed score and the teacher-assessed score. Any score above a 5.6 will be rounded up.

> self-assessed score*(.25)+ teacher score*(.75) = YOUR FINAL GRADE

*Example final score:*

    Self-assessed score = 5
    Teacher-assessed score = 6
    Final score = 5(.25) + 6(.75) = 5.75 = 6

### Criterion A: Knowing, understanding, and computational thinking

Students appropriately apply computer science concepts and tools in context. On top of computer science concepts and tools, students apply computational thinking practices including habits such as writing pseudocode, developing iteratively, using abstractions, decomposing problems, and debugging.

In this unit, we explored the imperative programming paradigm as well as the basic building blocks of computation. This allowed us to control our programs with various forms of control flow (loops, functions, and conditional statements). Finally, we learned about abstraction and decomposition, which allows us to create programs that could be reused for a variety of different contexts with a range of parameters.

### Criterion B: Planning and development
Students create personally meaningful projects through an iterative design cycle. Studentsâ€™ work is grounded in a development plan which students create before beginning the project. Students document the development of their projects in order to create a record of decisions, assumptions, and lingering flaws. Students define the intended functionality and develop towards evaluation.

In this unit, you planned a project with a design document and also adjusted the scope of your project, which means you pivoted your project accordingly to meet the deadlines. Additionally, you were introduced to the concept of documentation via `README.md` files and git commits on Github.

### Criterion D: Reflection on Tech and Society
Students demonstrate an understanding of their responsibility to society as technology creators by evaluating the implications of their work. Students investigate the applications of their work to specific problems or issues.
Throughout the unit, you explored what it means to express yourself and your identity via digital art.
