# Initial setup

**Welcome! These instructions will help you get your computer set up for the class.**
If you get stuck or are unsure what to do, ask {{< teacher >}}. Everyone's system is 
different, so the initial setup sometimes needs some TLC. 
*You should only ever have to run these instructions once.*

## Installing Python
To get your computer ready, we need to configure the workspace you will use for the class. **Select the tab for your operating system and follow the instructions.** Please let {{< teacher >}} know if you run into any issues. 


{{< tabs "computer-setup" >}}
{{< tab "MacOS" >}}

1. **Start by installing the latest version of Python.** [Open this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/), click "Download Python," and follow the installation instructions.

1. **Once the installation finishes, you will see a Finder window showing what was installed**. 
(If you closed the window, open Finder, click on "Applications," and then "Python 3.10" (or whatever version of Python you just installed).
1. **Double-click on "Install Certificates.command".** This will will open a Terminal window and run a bunch of commands. Once you see `[Process completed]`, you may close the window.

1. **Double-click on "Update Shell Profile.command".** Each of these will open a Terminal window and run a bunch of commands. Once you see `[Process completed]`, you may close the window.

{{< aside >}}
**If you see a red "Permission denied" error message when running "Install Certificates.command"**:
- open a Terminal window and run **`sudo "/Applications/Python 3.10/Install Certificates.command"`** 
- You will be asked for an administrator password; you won't see any letters appearing as you enter the password. This is a security feature.

## Install MWC

{{< code-action "Open Terminal and run the following command." >}}
`mwc` is a special program we wrote for this class which will help you set up your assignments.

```shell
pip3 install making-with-code-cli
```

{{< aside "If the install failed..." >}}

{{< code-action "Copy and paste each command, one at a time, into the Terminal." >}} 
- `sudo pip3 install making-with-code-cli` or 
- `pip3 install --user making-with-code-cli`

Still no luck? Talk to {{< teacher >}}. 
{{</ aside >}}

{{< code-action "Check mwc installed successfully by checking the version number." >}} You should see a version number above 0.0.5, such as `MWC 0.0.51`.
```shell
mwc version
```

---

## Configure MWC

{{< code-action "Run the below command to begin the full setup." >}} This will install a few packages onto your computer. This may take up to 30 minutes to complete. Don't worry, you can still use your computer and have it running in the background.
```shell
mwc setup
```
You will be asked some questions to finish the setup process. A few notes:
- We suggest accepting default values for now. You can change your settings later by re-running 
  `mwc setup`.
- You'll be asked for the Making With Code URL. That's this site, `{{< baseurl >}}`.
- When you are asked for your computer password, you won't see any letters appear as you type. 
  This is normal--it's to keep the person standing behind you from seeing your password.
