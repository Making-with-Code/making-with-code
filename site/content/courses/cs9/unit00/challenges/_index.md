Before you begin, consider how you will break the larger problem down into sub-probems.
For example,
1. First try to create *one* star
2. Next try to create a *row* of stars
3. ...
4. ...

{{< code-action "First, create a new file:" >}}
```shell
atom stars.py
```

{{< code-action "Copy and paste following into the top of yoru file to import the Turtle library at the start of the file:" >}}
```python
from turtle import *
```


{{< code-action "Now, it's up to you to recreate the image to the best of your ability!" >}}
