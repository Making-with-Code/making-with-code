# Getting started
Welcome to cs9! We're glad you're here! yay üòÑ

This lab will help you get your computer set up for the class and show you how to run your
first computer program.

{{< aside "FYI" >}}
*Hello! I'm the For Your Information Space Invader. I'll be stopping by
every once in a while to give you some extra information about labs or the content you're
learning.*

**Here's my first FYI:**

Sometimes you'll see üíª in a lab. This means that you
need do something that involves writing code or using your Terminal (MacOS) or Ubunutu (Windows). You can use these like
little action items during labs.
{{< /aside >}}

## [0] Setup
To get your computer ready, we need to configure the workspace you will use for the class. Select the tab for your operating system and follow the instructions. Please let {{< teacher >}} know if you run into any issues. 


{{< tabs "computer-setup" >}}
{{< tab "MacOS" >}}
{{< code-action "To begin, start your Terminal app and paste" >}} the following line into
the window that opens, and press `return`. Enter your computer's password when the window
prompts you (you won't see any text when you're typing but that's ok).


```shell
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-isf-academy/courseware/master/cs9_student_setup/setup_script.sh)
```

The script installs the programs you need to write and run your code and creates a `cs9`
folder and python environment on your Desktop. This is where you'll do all the code-based
work for the class.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Windows" >}}
### üíª Check system requirements 

1. Go to `Settings > System > About`.
1. Check that the Edition is Windows 10.
1. Check that System type says "64-bit operating system..."

*(based on [this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/228042/how-to-switch-from-32-bit-windows-10-to-64-bit-windows-10/))*



### üíª Ubunutu 
Follow along with this video until the '6:15' mark, or follow the steps below. Once you have Ubunutu installed, skip below to "Download VcXsrv for graphics". 

{{< youtube "1ap3hL-UR9I" >}}


#### Enable developer tools
1. Go to `Control Panel > Programs > Program Features > Turn Windows Features On Or Off`.
1. Enable the ‚ÄúWindows Subsystem for Linux‚Äù option in the list, and then click the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button.
1. Click ‚ÄúRestart now‚Äù when you‚Äôre prompted to restart your computer.

#### Download Ubuntu
1. After your computer restarts, open the Microsoft Store from the Start menu, and search for
‚ÄúUbunutu‚Äù in the store. 
1. Click `Get` to install "Ubuntu".

*(Based on [this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/))*

#### Setup Ubuntu
1. Open Ubuntu, it will take a few minutes to install updates.
1. As prompted, create a username and password.
1. Give your user admin privileges by typing `usermad -aG sudo your-name` and pressing enter
(again, replace `your-name`).


### üíªDownload VcXsrv for graphics
1. Download VcXsrv from [this link](https://www.onworks.net/software/windows/app-vcxsrv-windows-x-server) by clicking `Download App`. 
1. Install the package that downloads by double clicking on it and going through the install wizard.


### üíªDownload Atom
1. Download Atom from [this website](https://atom.io/) and install.

([This guide](https://medium.com/@rhdzmota/python-development-on-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-17a0fa1839d)
has instructions for installing shell commands to open files and projects in Atom)

### üíªSetup Script
In your Ubuntu window, copy and paste the following to run the setup script.

```shell
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-isf-academy/courseware/master/cs9_student_setup/setup_script_windows.sh)
```

{{< aside >}}
If this website says to use Terminal, you should use Ubuntu. There will be other small differences
for Windows users that we'll explain along the way.

## [1] Into the Terminal
Take a peek at your Desktop. You should see a new folder called `cs9` created by the configuration
script. We want to navigate to that folder using the Terminal interface to learn some Terminal skills
that will be useful throughout the class.

### Terminal: a new user interface

You're probably used to interacting with the files in your computer through a *Graphical User Interface
(GUI)* like Finder. Terminal allows us to interact with the files in our computer through a *Text-based
User Interface (TUI)*. The files in our computers are organized in nested folders known as
*directories*.

{{< code-action " Open a new Terminal window." >}}Terminal opens in your `home` directory, but we will be working in the `cs9` directory.
Since the home directory holds everything we will be working with on your computer, the `cs9` directory
must be somewhere inside the `home` directory (organized as a *child directory* or *subdirectory*).

```shell
Last login: Thu Aug 15 13:57:41 on ttys008
~$
```

### What's in your home directory?

{{< code-action >}} **Type** `ls` **into the command line and press** `return`. This will list all the files and subdirectories in the current directory.

```shell
~$ ls
Applications  Desktop  Documents  Downloads	 Library  Movies  Music	 Pictures
```

Here, you should see that `Desktop` is one of the subdirectories listed. Let's move into that
subdirectory. 

{{< code-action >}} **Type** `cd Desktop` **into the command line and press**
`return`.

`cd` stands for "change directory". Now, list all the items in your `Desktop`
directory using `ls`.

```shell
~$ cd Desktop
~/Desktop$ ls

cs9						                   lentil loaf gravy.pdf
```

### Compare the output in the Terminal window with the Desktop shown by the GUI.

{{< code-action >}} **Type** `open .` **to open Finder.** All of the files and folders are the same!
The Terminal really does show us the same files and directories as our GUI!

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/00_setup_compare_terminal_finder.png" width="100%" title="Comparing Finder and Terminal files" >}}

Going back to the Terminal, we can also see that the `cs9` subdirectory is inside the
`Desktop` directory. 

{{< code-action >}} **Change into the** `cs9` **directory and list what
it contains.** There is another subdirectory named `unit_00`, the directory we created
for you to hold everything for Unit 0. Change into that directory and we'll be ready
to get started with some actual code!

```shell
~/Desktop$ cd cs9/
direnv: loading ~/Desktop/cs9/.envrc
direnv: export ~PATH
~/Desktop/cs9$ ls
env	unit_00
~/Desktop/cs9$ cd unit_00/
~/Desktop/cs9/unit_00$
```

{{< aside >}}
Notice how something different happened when you `cd`'d into the `cs9` directory? A piece of
software the install script installed called `direnv` just activated a virtual environment
for you Terminal session. Basically, it keeps the things you do or the software you install
for the class from affecting other parts of your computer.

## [2] Introduction to writing code
Now that you can navigate in the Terminal, let's write some code! Throughout the class, we
will be using the Python programming language to help us perform computational tasks. In
this unit, we'll be using a software library called turtle to draw things with code.

{{< look-action "Watch or read the explanation of how to write and run Python programs below." >}} 

{{< aside >}}
The {{< look-action >}} symbol is another helpful symbol to indicate that you need to do
something. This one means that there's something important for you to read or watch.
{{< /aside >}}

{{< tabs python-programs >}}


{{< tab "Text Explanation" >}}
### Writing programs
Python programs start out as simple text files. To write a Python program, we start out
by writing a text file. During the setup, we downloaded a special text editor made for
the purpose of writing code. 

{{< code-action "Use the Terminal commands below to open a new file in Atom." >}} 

```shell
cd Desktop
cd cs9
cd unit_00
atom first_program.py
```

This should open a new Atom window with a tab that says `first_program.py`.

Python programs consist of lines of code that tell your computer what you want it to do.


{{< code-action >}} **Paste the following lines of code into the** `first_program.py` **file in Atom:**

```python
from turtle import *

forward(50)
right(90)
forward(50)
right(90)
forward(50)
right(90)
forward(50)
right(90)

input()
```

Can you guess what these lines of code are telling the computer to draw?

### Running programs
Now that you've written a program, let's run it to see what it does!

To run Python code, we need to give our programs to a python interpretor. Fortunately,
we installed a Python interpretor in your Terminal during the setup. To use it,
you can use the command `python file-name.py`. This will read in the text file you
pass it, interpret it as a Python program, translate it into a format that your computer
can understand, and then give those instructions to your computer.

Let's try it with the program you just wrote in Atom.  

{{< code-action "First, save" >}} `first_program.py` file in Atom using the** `cmd-s` keys.

{{< code-action "Run the program in Terminal" >}} using the command, `python first_program.py`.


What happend? Did your computer draw what you expected?

{{< code-action "End the program" >}} and close the turtle window by pressing `return`.

{{< aside >}}
Most files in your computer have a file type that tells your computer how to interpret them.
The file type is determined by the letters after the dot in the file name.

Notice that even though python programs are just text files, we're saving it with the `.py`
file extension. This tells our computer that this file should be interpreted as a python
file.

#### You just ran your first Python program! Congrats!! üéâ

Before we move on, here a summary of the commands you just learned:
{{< expand "Terminal and Atom commands" >}}
| Command                 | Description |
| :---------------------- | :-----------|
*In Terminal*
| `cd Desktop/cs9/unit_00`|to change to the directory "unit_00" |
| `atom .`                |  to open Atom.   |
| `atom newfilename.py`   |  to make a new file. You can also choose to make a new file by right-clicking on the folder in atom. |
*In Atom*
| `[Insert your code]`    |  In atom, edit the file. Remember to save (`‚åòS`)  the file after editing. |
*In Terminal*
| `python newfilename.py` |  to run the program. |
| `done`                  |  to end the program. |
| `‚Üë` + `ENTER`           |  to get to the previous command you typed in terminal |

### Error and bugs
While trying this out, you may come across errors or bugs, do not fear!
Write the issue down, and we can talk about it during class. Try to
figure out whether your bug is a:
{{< columns >}}
**Programmatic error** (which happens when the program does something different than what
you wanted. Remember that this happened when we set the angle to the wrong number)

<--->

**Syntax error** (which happens when the program crashes because the program cannot be
understood by the computer. Remember that this happened when we forgot a parentheses).
