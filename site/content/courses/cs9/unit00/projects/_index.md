# Animation Project

In this project you will make an animated drawing (or a GIF!) using Python's turtle library.

It's up to you to make a drawing you actually care about making. Your teachers will help you choose a project that's a good level of challenge.

Here are a few examples from last year to get you started. More can be found at the `gallery` page.

## [0] Planning Document

This is a big project, and you will get lost or frustrated if you don't do some planning up front. You are required to write a project planning document and get it approved by a teacher. Your planning document can be found in your Google Drive folder.


{{< write-action "Fill out your planning doc in your Google Drive folder." >}} First you must spend 10 minutes creating an inspiration board. 


**ðŸ‘€ Once you have completed your planning document, meet with a teacher to talk through your project.**

##  [1] Starter Code

For this project, your code will live in a git repository. It is your responsibility to regularly commit to your repository.

{{< code-action "Download your respository with starter code for your project." >}}
> replace the `yourGithubUsername` with your Github username.
>
> *example:*
>
> *`git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/project_animation_emmaqbrown.git`*


```shell
cd Desktop
cd cs9/unit_00
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/project_animation_yourGithubUsername.git
```

It contains the following files:
- `project.py` When this program runs, it should draw your project.
- `settings.py` This is where you settings for your animation should be stored.
- `README.md` This is documentation for your project for other people who may want to use your project.
    

{{< code-action "Start coding your first milestone!" >}} With you design document approved by a teacher and your starter code downloaded, you're ready to start creating.

### Criterion A: Knowing, understanding, and computational thinking

Students appropriately apply computer science concepts and tools in context. On top of computer science concepts and tools, students apply computational thinking practices including habits such as writing pseudocode, developing iteratively, using abstractions, decomposing problems, and debugging.

In this unit, we explored the imperative programming paradigm as well as the basic building blocks of computation. This allowed us to control our programs with various forms of control flow (loops, functions, and conditional statements). Finally, we learned about abstraction and decomposition, which allows us to create programs that could be reused for a variety of different contexts with a range of parameters.

### Criterion B: Planning and development
Students create personally meaningful projects through an iterative design cycle. Studentsâ€™ work is grounded in a development plan which students create before beginning the project. Students document the development of their projects in order to create a record of decisions, assumptions, and lingering flaws. Students define the intended functionality and develop towards evaluation.

In this unit, you planned a project with a design document and also adjusted the scope of your project, which means you pivoted your project accordingly to meet the deadlines. Additionally, you were introduced to the concept of documentation via `README.md` files and git commits on Github.

### Criterion D: Reflection on Tech and Society
Students demonstrate an understanding of their responsibility to society as technology creators by evaluating the implications of their work. Students investigate the applications of their work to specific problems or issues.
Throughout the unit, you explored what it means to express yourself and your identity via digital art.
