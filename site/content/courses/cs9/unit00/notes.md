+ 10 class meetings
+ This initial unit prioritizes getting students making personally-meaningful things as fast as possible. This means we aren’t aiming for completeness. In particular, we’re not introducing variables or conditional control structures in this unit: most students won’t need them, and we’ll spend a lot of time with them in the next unit.

### Problem sets

Assign students to create various drawing primitives, and use them to build up more complex functions. Note: Require all primitives end with the turtle in the same state as when it started. This makes building up more complex routines much easier.

### Lab

Practice using pseudocode to plan algorithms. Use this method to write pseudocode (and then code) to generate complex puzzle pictures such as geometric designs, tessellations, and procedurally-generated patterns from nature.

### Project

Create some personally-meaningful drawing. First, a draft will be due with a sketch of the final project and some planning, including planned subroutines and pseudocode. Use it to make something using the fablab. (eg: engrave your laptop, cut patterns in clothes, mill some useful shape.
