# Pandas and Matplotlib Lab
In this lab, you will be introduced to two data science Python frameworks, Pandas and Matplotlib. 

## A. Setup

Start by cloning your lab repo from Github.

{{< code-action >}} Starter code for the lab is provided in the
`lab-pandas-matplotlib` repo. Download it *onto your laptop*.

```shell
$ cd cs9/unit_01
$ git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/lab-pandas-matplotlib-YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.git
```

## B. Intro to Pandas and Matplotlib

Pandas and Matplotlib are widely used Python frameworks for data science. Pandas is used to analyze large data sets and Matplotlib is used to visualize it. 

{{< code-action >}} Open Jupyter notebook inside of your repository: `jupyter notebook`

{{< code-action >}} Open the `pandas-matplotlib.ipynb` lab in Jupyter using the window that popped up in your web browser. **Complete the lab in the Jupyter notebook.**


*Each person should work on their own lab, but you can
work together in groups to complete it.*

## C. Deliverables
For this lab, you should submit the following...

- Your `pandas-matplotlib.ipynb` file with code for each exercise
