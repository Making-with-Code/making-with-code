# Summary Statistics Lab

## Set Up

How do you make sense of lots of data? Let's summarize it with statistics and graphs!  

ðŸ’» **TODO: Install matplotlib**

On Mac, go to terminal and type:

`python -m pip install -U matplotlib`

On Windows, go to terminal and type:

`pip3 install --user matplotlib` OR `python3-pip install --user matplotlib`

ðŸ’» **TODO:** Create an individual repository for the lab using the following links:

If you are in **CS 1**, [click here](https://classroom.github.com/a/-jNZjIjf).

If you are in **CS 2**, [click here](https://classroom.github.com/a/igjU-Mpm).

ðŸ’» **In the Jupyter file navigator, open `summstats.Rmd`. Save it and close it and then open `summstats.ipynb`.**

## Part 1 - 4: Learn the tools of summary statistics
These parts should be completed in your individual repos, but do ask your table groups for help. Use the companion worksheet to help you along this part!

### 1. Set Up
### 2. Calculate the Measures of Central Tendency, aka "Middle".  
   Specifically, you will be implementing mean, median, mode.  
### 3. Calculate the Measures of Spread.  
   Specifically, you will be implementing the interquartile range and percentile.
