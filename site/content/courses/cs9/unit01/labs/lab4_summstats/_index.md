# 4. Summary Statistics Lab

## Set Up

How do you make sense of lots of data? Let's summarize it with statistics and graphs!  

ðŸ’» **TODO: Install matplotlib**

On Mac, go to terminal and type:

`python -m pip install -U matplotlib`

On Windows, go to terminal and type:

`pip3 install --user matplotlib` OR `python3-pip install --user matplotlib`

ðŸ’» **TODO:** Create an individual repository for the lab using the following links:

If you are in **CS 1**, [click here](https://classroom.github.com/a/-jNZjIjf).

If you are in **CS 2**, [click here](https://classroom.github.com/a/igjU-Mpm).

ðŸ’» **In the Jupyter file navigator, open `summstats.Rmd`. Save it and close it and then open `summstats.ipynb`.**

## Part 1 - 4: Learn the tools of summary statistics
These parts should be completed in your individual repos, but do ask your table groups for help. Use the companion worksheet to help you along this part!

### 1. Set Up
### 2. Calculate the Measures of Central Tendency, aka "Middle".  
   Specifically, you will be implementing mean, median, mode.  
### 3. Calculate the Measures of Spread.  
   Specifically, you will be implementing the interquartile range and percentile.
### 4. Generate Data Visualizations.
   Specifically, you will be able to generate a box plot, bar graph, scatter plot, and histogram.

## Part 5: Answer questions

You will complete this part together with your group. Split up the four subquestions among the four of you.

### A. Who took our survey?
For this part, you will be analyzing the grade levels of survey respondents.

### B.How long do ISF students spend on social media everyday?
For this part, you will be analyzing the number of hours that survey respondents spend on social media.

### C.Question of your group's choice.
For this part, you will pick another piece of the data from the social media dataset, choose four ways to summarize the data, and record your insights.
