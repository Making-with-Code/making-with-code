In functional programming, we think of functions as transformations. They take any number of **arguments** and they change them into a **return value**.
Remember the structure of a Python function?

```python
    def double(number):
        return 2 * number
```

Here, `number` is the argument and `2 * number` is the return value. As its name suggests, this function returns twice `number`.

In this lab, we are going to write some functions inspired by Unit 0: Drawing.

If you have not already, ðŸ’» **create a directory `unit1` in your `cs9` folder.**

From now on, all code-based assignments will be downloaded and submitted through Github. Just push your work to submit!

For this lab, use the following link to create a repo for your lab work.

If you are in **CS 1**, [click here](https://classroom.github.com/a/r13vhXjj).

If you are in **CS 2**, [click here](https://classroom.github.com/a/C8pBPH32).

ðŸ’» **Clone the lab repo into your `unit_01` directory and `cd` inside.**

*Reminder: to clone a github repo, use the `clone [URL]` command replacing `[URL]` with the url that appears after clicking the green Clone or download button on the Github website.*
