# Summary Statistics Lab
In this lab, you will practice using Jupyter Notebook and write algorithms to calculate statistics about datasets.

## [0] Pseudocode

How do you make sense of lots of data? You can summarize it with statistics!

#### Calculate The Central Tendency
When you have a ton of data, you might want to find one number to summarize the data. How about the middle?  

Here are three ways to find the middle: 
- Mean: the average of a list of numbers
- Median: the middle number in a sorted list of numbers
- Mode: value that appears most frequently in a data set


In this lab, we will write the algorithms to find the median, mean, and mode of a list of numbers. Before jumping into the Python code, letâ€™s write the pseudocode so we can be sure our algorithm works as intended.

## [1] Translating Pseudocode

### [Setup]

Now that you are confident in your algorithms, try to translate them into Python code.

{{< code-action >}} **Starter code for the lab is provided in the `lab-sumstats` repo.** 
```shell
cd cs9/unit_01
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/lab-sumstats-YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.git
```

### [sumstats.ipynb]

{{< code-action >}} **Open the `sumstats.ipynb` file by typing `jupyter notebook` in your Terminal.** Be sure to read cell by cell, and follow along with instructions.

*Each person should write their own code, but you can work together to complete each function.*

### [Deliverables]


{{< deliverables >}}
For this lab, you should submit the following...

- Your `sumstats.ipynb` file with code for each of the following functions:
    - `calculate_mean()`
    - `calculate_median()`
    - `calculate_mode()`

Also be sure to hand in your Summary Stats Lab Worksheet.
