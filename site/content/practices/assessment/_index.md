# Assessment
The course utilizes the following critieria as a guide for learning priorities and for learning assessment.

|   | Criterion                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **A** | **Knowing, understanding, and computational thinking**  | Students appropriately apply computer science concepts and tools in context. On top of computer science concepts and tools, students apply computational thinking practices including habits such as writing pseudocode, developing iteratively, using abstractions, decomposing problems, and debugging.                                                                                         |
| **B** | **Planning and development**                            | Students create personally meaningful projects through an iterative design cycle. Studentsâ€™ work is grounded in a development plan which students create before beginning the project. Students document the development of their projects in order to create a record of decisions, assumptions, and lingering flaws. Students define the intended functionality and develop towards evaluation. |
| **C** | **Evaluation**                                          | Students produce evidence of a testing plan that evaluates the main areas of functionality of the product and reflect on the development process as well as a proposal for further development to improve the shortcomings of the current product.                                                                                                                                                |
| **D** | **Reflecting on the impacts of technology**             | Students demonstrate an understanding of their responsibility to society as technology creators by evaluating the implications of their work. Students investigate the applications of their work to specific problems or issues.                                                                                                                                                                 |
