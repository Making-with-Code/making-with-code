# Teaching Making with Code

Our goal is for teaching *MwC* and implementing in your school to be a seamless setup process. 

## Repositories

ðŸ’» **All code is publicly available at [github.com/Making-with-Code](https://github.com/Making-with-Code).** We reccomend creating a new Github organization and forking the repositories as needed. 

If students are able to use Git and have Github accounts, you can create personalized repositories for each students under the organization. You can learn more about this process in [courseware](courseware)
