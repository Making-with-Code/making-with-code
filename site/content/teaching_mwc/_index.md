# Teaching Making with Code

Developing, implementing, and customing *Making with Code* is easy to do!

All code is publicly available at [github.com/Making-with-Code](https://github.com/Making-with-Code).

Our site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and can be easily hosted using Github pages. The site repoistory can be found at [github.com/Making-with-Code/making-with-code](https://github.com/Making-with-Code/making-with-code). 

*Making with Code* was developed in a partnership with The Indepdent Schools Foundation Academy (ISF). You can see their site implementation at [the-isf-academy.github.io/making-with-code](https://the-isf-academy.github.io/making-with-code/).


MwC has also been implemented in a teacher preparation program through SUNY Buffalo. You can see their site implementation at [https://makingwithcode.org/](https://makingwithcode.org/).
