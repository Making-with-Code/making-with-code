## Starter Whiteboard Actvities

We start each class with starter exercises that align with the current lab content. They are designed for students to have 'quick wins' and review important material before the more open-ended lab content.

Students typically complete each Do Now on a small white board at their desk to encourage engagement and non-permant guessing.


## Kahoots


## Parsons Problems 

## Worksheets

## Self-assessments
