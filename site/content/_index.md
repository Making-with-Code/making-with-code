# Making with Code

*Making with Code* is a new, old approach to teaching computer science based in Constructionism. It's new because it draws on the tools of modern computational practice and is grounded in youths' digital worlds. It is old because technologists have been dreaming of an empowering, transformative integration of education and technology for over half a century. 


*Making with Code* is a set of free, open-source computer science courses and
related curriculum. More about what this actually is and how it can be used.
TLTL provides training.

### About us
