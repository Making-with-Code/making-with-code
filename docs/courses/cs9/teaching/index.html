  <article class="markdown"><h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This is a 9th grade constructionist computer science course. <strong>The central goal is to create a rich, diverse community of people making things with code, through which they can develop personal relationships with powerful ideas.</strong> The course is designed to help all students learn to interact with code as an expressive, evocative medium, which helps to structure thought. At the same time, the course is designed to support computational literacy, connecting with students’ existing ways of reading and writing. We consider computational thinking as <em>thinking with code</em>.</p>
<p>The course is guided by several core beliefs about learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge is constructed, not transferred. Every learner builds knowledge anew.</li>
<li>Knowledge-building is social and grounded in people, places, and materials.</li>
<li>At its heart, computer science is about getting to know powerful ideas. This happens best when working on projects that matter to you and your peers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="course-goals">Course goals</h3>
<p>This course is designed for students who have no prior formal exposure to computer science, but who have substantial experience with computing in and out of school. The course is expected to be part of a grade 9-12 sequence, culminating in IB computer science exams and preparation for participation in university-level computer science for students who choose to continue study.</p>
<p>The course goals are aligned with the <a href="%7bstatic%7d/resources/csta_2017_standards.pdf">CSTA 2017 Standards</a>, which are in turn based on the <a href="https://k12cs.org/">K12 CS Framework</a>. The K12 CS Framework articulates high-level concepts and practices for primary and secondary computer science; the CSTA 2017 standards articulate grade-level criteria for the concepts and practices. The course does not align strictly to CSTA 2017 Level 3A (grades 9-10) because those standards assume students have previously been learning the earlier standards.</p>
