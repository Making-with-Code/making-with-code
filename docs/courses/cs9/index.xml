      <description>Course structures Infrastructure The course will be taught in Python. Each student will do her work primarily in Github repositories. We will use GitHub Classroom to manage assignments. Each project, lab, and problem set will be a separate repo.
Assessment Projects and labs will be assessed manually, giving feedback not just on correctness but on style, etc. Problem sets will be graded automatically via GitHub webhooks&amp;ndash;every time commits are pushed, the auto-grader will assess the assignment and create or update an Issue giving feedback.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is a 9th grade constructionist computer science course. The central goal is to create a rich, diverse community of people making things with code, through which they can develop personal relationships with powerful ideas. The course is designed to help all students learn to interact with code as an expressive, evocative medium, which helps to structure thought. At the same time, the course is designed to support computational literacy, connecting with studentsâ€™ existing ways of reading and writing.</description>
