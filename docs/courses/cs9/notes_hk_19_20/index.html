  <article class="markdown"><h2 id="course-structures">Course structures</h2>
<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p>One primary structure in the course will be open-ended projects. The initial units will provide scaffolding, supporting students in designing and implementing projects. Later in the year, students will design their own projects independently.</p>
<h3 id="labs">Labs</h3>
<p>Students will work on labs in class which integrate the skills and emphasize developing collaborative problem-solving. Early in the year, labs and projects will be tightly-integrated; students will be guided through creating projects. One feature of labs is that we will be providing some of the libraries students use, allowing them to interact with broader computational systems than they would be able to do on their own. For example, students will initially encounter machine library through functions we provide which allow them to do powerful things with their code.</p>
<h3 id="problem-sets">Problem Sets</h3>
<p>There will be regularly-assigned problem sets supporting students in practicing their skills. (We should assess school culture, but I like the idea of having a small problem set due in each day of class). Students may work together on these, but they must be coded independently. Problem sets will be assessed automatically so that students get immediate feedback. Generally, problem sets will lag behind labs so that they are practice with content we’ve already explored together.</p>
<h3 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h3>
<p>The course will be taught in Python. Each student will do her work primarily in Github repositories. We will use GitHub Classroom to manage assignments. Each project, lab, and problem set will be a separate repo.</p>
<h3 id="assessment">Assessment</h3>
<p>Projects and labs will be assessed manually, giving feedback not just on correctness but on style, etc. Problem sets will be graded automatically via GitHub webhooks&ndash;every time commits are pushed, the auto-grader will assess the assignment and create or update an Issue giving feedback. We will use pedal to automatically grade problem sets.</p>

<p>Late - deduct 1 point for submissions between 1-7 days late<br>
We will not accept late submissions after 7 days<br>
Revised work - If you submit something that you put a good faith effort by the first deadline and you want to revise the homework, we can accept revisions up until the end of the unit.</p>
<p>When we assess students’ work manually, we will give feedback on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creativity</strong> of the homework submission</li>
<li><strong>Courage</strong> with code -  willingness to experiment / try new things</li>
<li><strong>Effectiveness</strong> of concepts/tools usage -  Appropriate, effective use of tools and concepts (suggest when there could be a better option)</li>
<li><strong>Coding style</strong>
<ul>
<li>Descriptive function and variable naming</li>
<li>Documenting the functionality of functions with comments</li>
<li>Decomposition of programs into functions</li>
<li>Efficiency and elegance of code</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="norms">Norms</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Getting help:</strong> When working on individual projects and on problem sets, students will often need help from teachers. It is important to create structures to allocate teacher time so that pushier students can’t dominate, and to build a culture where it’s a good thing to be stuck, to need help, and to seek help.
<ul>
<li>One useful tool is the help queue, simply a list on the whiteboard where people can sign up if they need help. All the people sign up at the beginning of class get helped in a random order (to prevent a rush). Respect the queue.</li>
<li>Encourage students to seek help from peers. And to look for help online. In particular, it’s not OK to sit idly waiting for help from a teacher.</li>
<li>When many students are having the same issue, it may be time to schedule a mini-lesson, 10 or 15 minutes dedicated to working an example to address the issue in a side part of the classroom. All students would be invited (but generally not required to attend). This would generally take priority over helping individuals, since it can help many people at once.</li>
<li>When a student is really struggling and needs ongoing support, it can be helpful to break things down into small tasks, help the student get to the point where she can tackle one, and then say, “It looks like you can do this part. Can I go help somebody else and then check back in with you in five minutes?” Make sure you do!</li>
<li>Github issues will make it easier to create a practice of identifying problems and asking for help offline. This could be productively combined with office hours. If this turns out to be helpful, it could be nice to occasionally make this work visible in class, for example by starting class off by presenting an interesting bug. (Some students will be much more comfortable asking for this kind of help; when they see that others are doing so, it can help them to also ask for help.)</li>
<li>Stanford CS TA’s often had a practice of not looking at students’ code (they wanted to help debug thinking, not code). We believe this is not a helpful stance for supporting beginners.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Funds of knowledge</strong> refers to the idea that we will look at students as having lots of resources they can deploy in their learning (rather than viewing them in terms of their deficits). This also means we need to let go of the idea that we’re solely in the position of determining what’s worthwhile in CS. Our students are going to create things that are worthwhile and successful on their terms, not ours. We are going to support them, while also being warmly demanding. This is not a radical proposition, especially in CS: It’s such a new field that nobody really knows what CS is or what its boundaries are. If we’re finding ways of working that are effective, thinking about ideas that feel powerful, and making things that feel like they matter, then we’re doing the right thing.</li>
<li><strong>Assigning competence:</strong> Create practices by which students are seen as experts.
<ul>
<li>One useful practice that embodies this: when helping people from the queue, follow up helping a student by saying, “It looks like you understand this issue pretty well now. When I see another student having the same problem, may I send them to you for help?” That way, the student solidifies the understanding by teaching someone else, and gets to be an expert at that issue. You can then keep directing students to that expert for days.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Authorship:</strong> It is very important that each student develop as an author of her code.
<ul>
<li>Never touch a student’s keyboard. Instead, sit with the student and guide her in what to do. It can be helpful to bring another laptop, increase the font size, and type out code for the student to copy. It’s also great to have portable whiteboards or writable desk surfaces, so you can develop pseudocode together that then stays with the student. (The only exception would be if there is some error at a deeper level than the student would be expected to know about, eg incompatible package versions installed.)</li>
<li>For problem sets, students should never look at each others’ code. They may work on problems together, using pseudocode and diagrams. This is going to be a challenge, because pair programming might be very productive during labs and group projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Groupwork:</strong> Small groups are an important context for high-quality disciplinary talk. When students get to choose their groups, they can take advantage of existing social relationships. However, this can create in equities (the strongest students cluster together) and can also bring social tensions into the classroom.
<ul>
<li>Our recommendation is to always assign seats and groups, change groups regularly (perhaps every unit), and allow students some private input (eg “I really don’t get along with X”).</li>
</ul>
</li>
